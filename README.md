# consent-gtm-reference-template

This is a refrence tag template for using DataGrail Consent within your Google Tag Manager workspace. You must have a DataGrail account to create a customer and container UUID for use. While this template will offer basic integration support, we recommend using our publishing process to build and deploy a specific template that is configured based on your environment setup.

# consent-gtm-reference-template

This is a reference tag template for using DataGrail Consent within your Google Tag Manager workspace. You must have a DataGrail account to create a customer and container UUID for use. While this template will offer basic integration support, we recommend using our publishing process to build and deploy a specific template that is configured based on your environment setup.

To learn more about DataGrail Consent and our Google Tag Manager integration, [see here](https://docs.datagrail.io/docs/consent/deployment-paths/tag-manager). You can learn more about DataGrail Consent [by visiting this overview page](https://www.datagrail.io/platform/consent-management/).
